# Allowing native coin to be deposited results in native coin being stuck in the contract forever.

## Summary
Allowing native coin to be deposited results in native coin being stuck in the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
The queue proxy contract and auction proxy contract allows native coin to be deposited (See QueueProxy.sol#L46 and AuctionProxy.sol#L33) but there is no code available to allow native coin to be used or to be withdrawn.

## Impact
Ether may be stuck in the contract forever.
