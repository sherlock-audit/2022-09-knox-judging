# [NAZ-M2] Lack of Price Freshness Check In `_latestAnswer64x64()` Allows A Stale Price To Be Used

## Summary
`PricerInternal.sol` should use the `updatedAt` value from the `latestRoundData()` function to make sure that the latest answer is recent enough to be used.

## Vulnerability Detail
This could lead to stale prices being used.

If the market price of the token drops very quickly ("flash crashes"), and Chainlink's feed does not get updated in time, the smart contract will continue to believe the token is worth more than the market value.

Chainlink also advise developers to check for the `updatedAt` before using the price

## Impact
A stale price can cause the malfunction of multiple features across the protocol.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the missing freshness check for stale price.
