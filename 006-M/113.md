# Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData might return stale or incorrect results

## Vulnerability Detail
On PricerInternal, we are using latestRoundData, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.
```solidity
    function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
        (, int256 basePrice, , , ) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 underlyingPrice, , , ) =
            UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
    }
```
This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation:
