# Lack of storage Gap in Upgradeable contracts

## Summary
While creating Upgradeable contracts, special care must be taken when dealing with storage slots. When the contract is upgraded in the future, the storage slots specifications remain same . 


## Vulnerability Detail
In future when the contract will be upgraded, there is a strong possibility for storage collisions.
## Impact
It can severly damage the protocol as  storage slots will be mixed up

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Hence, to avoid collision with existing storage slots, a gap in storage is recommended for future upgrades.

Consider adding a uint array with private visiblity
[Openzeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#use-upgradeable-libraries) 
```solidity

Uint[50] private __gap 

```
