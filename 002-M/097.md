# [NAZ-M1] Admin of The Upgradeable Proxy Contract (The Diamond Contract) Can Rug Users

## Summary
Use of Upgradeable Proxy Contract Structure (The Diamond Structure) allows the logic of the contract to be arbitrarily changed. This allows the proxy admin to perform malicious actions e.g., taking funds from users' wallets up to the allowance limit. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This action can be performed by the malicious/compromised proxy admin without any restriction. Considering that the main purpose of this particular contract is for bridging tokens with multiple bridge operators, we believe it's not necessary for the diamond contract to hold users' allowances.

## Impact
Owner has complete freedom to change any functionality and withdraw/rug all assets. Even if well intended the project could still be called out resulting in a damaged reputation like in this [example](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing extra safeguards such as:

1. Limiting the time period where sensitive functions can be used.
2. Having a waiting period before pushed update is executed.
3. Using a multisig to mitigate single point of failure in case owner private key leaks.
