# Chainlink oracle isn't validated properly

## Summary

Chainlink oracles have to be validated for the data's recency. Otherwise, the Auction contract might work with stale data.

## Vulnerability Detail

A recent example is the crash of LUNA and UST. The LUNA Chainlink oracle stopped updating at a price of $0.10 although the actual price of the asset was way lower. That allowed attackers to borrow more assets for their deposited LUNA tokens than they should be on the Blizz protocol, see [their post mortem](https://medium.com/@blizzfinance/blizz-finance-post-mortem-2425a33fe28b).
The Knox protocol's Pricer contract doesn't validate the oracle at all which makes it vulnerable to the same issue as Blizz.

## Impact

The Auction contract would work with the wrong price data

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/pricer/PricerInternal.sol#L49

```sol
    function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
        (, int256 basePrice, , , ) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 underlyingPrice, , , ) =
            UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
    }
```
