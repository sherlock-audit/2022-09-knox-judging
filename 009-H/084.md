# Underflow in `_previewWithdraw()` causing DoS


## Summary

In `_previewWithdraw()`, the `totalContractsSold` could grow larger than `auction.totalContracts` before the buyer's order is reached. Then the underflow will revert, `withdraw()` function will not work, user funds will be locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

If the orders before the current buyer add up above `auction.totalContracts`, in the if block:
```solidity
    uint256 remainder =
        auction.totalContracts - totalContractsSold;
```
will revert due to underflow.


## Impact

- `withdraw()` function could fail due to DoS.
- User funds could get locked temporarily or forever.
