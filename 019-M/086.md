# `epochsByBuyer[]` can lose records

## Summary

When `cancelLimitOrder()`, the `epoch` will be removed from `epochsByBuyer[]`, but the user could have other orders on the orderbook, the record will be inaccurate and mislead the users.


## Vulnerability Detail

If a user put 2 limit orders with different prices, 2 separate id will be assigned, but only 1 epoch will be added to the `epochsByBuyer[]` array. 
If the user cancel 1 of the orders, the `epoch` will be removed from `epochsByBuyer[]`, it will be impossible to track the other orders put by the user. And the `getEpochsByBuyer()` function will return inaccurate result.



## Impact

If some users rely on the results of `getEpochsByBuyer()` for new orders, the returned inaccurate results could be misleading, and cause potential loss to the users due to wrong information.
