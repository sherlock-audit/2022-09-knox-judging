# _previewWithdraw function in AuctionInternal.sol has unbounded gas consumption loop and can block user from withdraw 

## Summary

_previewWithdraw function in AuctionInternal.sol has unbounded gas consumption loop and can block user from withdraw 

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L212-L219

function _previewWithdraw traverses the orderbook and returns the refund and fill amounts,

however, if the orderbook have a lot of order, the gas may running out in the for loop below inside the function _previewWithdraw
