# Not compatible with Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary tokens

## Summary
Not compatible with Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
The Queue and Auction contracts do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. This can lead to failed withdrawals or lost assets in the some functions due to the number of tokens received by the contract is different from that recorded

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens
Consider to check before/after balance on the vault.
