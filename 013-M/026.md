# processAuction() in VaultAdmin.sol can be called multiple times by keeper if the auction is canceled.

## Summary

processAuction() in VaultAdmin.sol can be called multiple times by keeper if the auction is canceled.

## Vulnerability Detail

processAuction() in VaultAdmin.sol can be called multiple times by keeper, the code below would execute more than one times
if the auction is canceled.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/vault/VaultAdmin.sol#L259-L280

because it is the line of code inside the function processAuction in VaultAdmin.sol below that can change the auction status to PROCESSED. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/vault/VaultAdmin.sol#L326

this code only runs when the auction is finalized, it not finalized, the auction is in Canceled State and 

```solidity
   bool cancelled = l.Auction.isCancelled(lastEpoch);
        bool finalized = l.Auction.isFinalized(lastEpoch);

        require(
            (!finalized && cancelled) || (finalized && !cancelled),
            "auction is not finalized nor cancelled"
        );
```

would always pass because the auction is in cancel state.

## Impact

Why the processAuction should not be called multiple times?

In the first time it is called, the withdrawal lock is released so user can withdraw fund,

```solidity
 // deactivates withdrawal lock
  l.auctionProcessed = true;
```

then if we called again, the lastTotalAssets can be updated multiple times.

```solidity
        // stores the last total asset amount, this is effectively the amount of assets held
        // in the vault at the start of the auction
        l.lastTotalAssets = _totalAssets();
```

the total asset can be lower and lower because people are withdrawing their fund.

then when _collectPerformanceFee is called, the performance may still be collected

## Recommendation

We recommend the project lock the epoch and make it impossible for keeper to call the processAuction again.
