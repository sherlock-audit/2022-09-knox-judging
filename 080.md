# Auction can potentially sell more contracts than it has collateral for.

## Summary
`auction.totalContracts` is determined by the amount of collateral the protocol has received. After an auction has ended, users are allowed to withdraw and what they receive depends on whether their orders have filled, or they receive a refund, or a mixture of both. However, wrong accounting in `_previewWithdraw()` can lead to the `fill` and `refund` value to be calculated wrongly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Each time a withdrawal is made, the order is removed from the order book as seen in L339 in `_previewWithdraw()`. Now, the issue here is in the line `totalContractsSold += data.size`. If a user with an order that is higher priced, that is with a lower index in the order book( since order book is in decreasing order based on price ), chooses to withdraw first, their order is removed from the order book. Now, the next user who does a withdraw will call this same function, but `totalContractsSold` is calculated from 0 again. This leads to problems and I illustrate with a simple example below.


Assume,
`auction.totalContracts = 10`

Alice first `addLimitOrder()` with `price = 10`, `size = 10`.
Bob then `addLimitOrder()` with `price = 10`, 'size = 1'.

Now order book have 2 orders.

`processOrder()` is then called, since utilisation reaches a 100%, clearing price is set to 10 and all contracts are sold to Alice.
Now, Alice does a withdraw first and withdraws successfully with `fill = 10, refund = 0`. Now Bob tries to withdraw, the previous order is removed from the order book, so when `i = 1`, it enters the `if (data.price64x64 >= lastPrice64x64)` check. This time, `if (totalContractsSold + data.size >= auction.totalContracts)` check does not pass since `totalContractsSold = 0, data.size = 1, auction.totalContracts = 10`. It will then enter the else part where `fill += data.size`. This means that additional contracts are being sold to Bob even though it has been previously sold to Alice which exceeds the limit that the collateral allows.

## Impact
Auction is selling more contracts than it has collateral for which creates plenty of liquidity problems / issues with risk as options are now "naked".

Manual Review

## Recommendation

This problem arises due to how orders that have the same price as the clearing price, yet should not be filled due to exceeding the limit is not accounted for. A check in `_previewWithdraw()` needs to be done to prevent this edge case.

I believe removing an order from the order book after withdrawal is done to prevent multiple withdrawals from the same user. If this is the case, we can use a mapping to check this instead, so that `totalContractsSold` remains accurate. We can then refund users once this exceeds `auction.totalContracts`.
