# Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated.

## Summary
Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/pricer/PricerInternal.sol#L49-L55

## Vulnerability Detail
Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price and round completeness.
Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `price` return value.

## Impact
Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `price` return value.

## Code Snippet

Function `_latestAnswer64x64()` calls `latestRoundData()` to get the `basePrice` and `underlyingPrice`
```solidity
function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
    (, int256 basePrice, , , ) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
    (, int256 underlyingPrice, , , ) =
        UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

    return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding validation for data feed

```solidity
(uint80 roundID, int256 basePrice, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
require(basePrice > 0, "price <= 0");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "stale price");
require(timestamp > 0, "round not complete");
```
