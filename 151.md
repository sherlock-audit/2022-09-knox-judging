### getPositivePlaceValues(int128) can revert with a small argument

The key part of this vulnerability is the ruler variable. This is determined by the argument and
can result in a division by zero. The following code shows how this can occur:
        // setup the second place value
        values[1].ruler = ruler / 10;
        values[1].value = (integer / values[1].ruler) % 10;

        // setup the third place value
        values[2].ruler = ruler / 100;
        values[2].value = (integer / values[2].ruler) % 10;

If ruler is less than 10 (or 100 in the second portion of the code) it will result in an operation
the does a integer / 0 operation which would cause a reverted transaction.

A concrete example that shows how this problem could arise is by using an input value of 125. This
result in values[2].ruler being set to 0 (values[2].ruler = ruler / 100; ) which will then cause
a division by zero (values[2].value = (integer / 0) % 10;)
