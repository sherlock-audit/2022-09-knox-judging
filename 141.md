# `AuctionInternal._previewWithdraw()` might return the wrong result after some orders are removed during the withdrawal.

## Summary
`AuctionInternal._previewWithdraw()` might return the wrong result after some orders are removed during the withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The auction state will be changed to `FINALIZED` and `PROCESSED` when `totalContractsSold` is greater than `auction.totalContracts` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L391).

```solidity
if (totalContractsSold + data.size >= totalContracts) {
    auction.lastPrice64x64 = data.price64x64;
    auction.totalContractsSold = totalContracts;
    return true;
}
```
- When several users added orders with the same `price64x64`, the earlier user will be selected because the later users will be added in the right subtree [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/OrderBook.sol#L214-L221).

```solidity
// The new order belongs in the right subtree
if (price64x64 <= currentOrder.data.price64x64) {
    if (currentOrder.right == 0) {
        currentOrder.right = id;
    }
    currentOrder = index.orders[currentOrder.right];
    continue;
}
```

Currently, `_previewWithdraw()` removes the order during the withdrawal but it might return the wrong result after some orders are removed.

- Let's assume `auction.totalContracts = 10` and 2 users added limit orders.
- First, a user `Alice` added 1 limit order, `Order1 = {price64x64 = 80, size = 6}`.
- A user `Bob` added 2 limit orders. `Order2 = {price64x64 = 100, size = 6}`, `Order3 = {price64x64 = 80, size = 4}`.
- After the auction is started, it will be finalized at price 80 from [_processOrders()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L359).
- So from [this part](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L392-L393), `auction.lastPrice64x64 = 80`, `auction.totalContractsSold = 10`.
- After that, the auction was processed and users are trying to withdraw their funds using `withdraw()`.
- Because `Alice` added the limit order earlier than `Bob`, `Alice` should have 4 of 10, `Bob` should have 6 of 10.
- `Bob` withdrew 6 of 10 properly and `Order2` and `Order3` was removed from the `OrderBook` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L339).
- After that, when `Alice` tries to withdraw, `_previewWithdraw()` will output `fill = 6` because the `OrderBook` contains only 1 order, `Order1`.
- So `Alice` will receive `fill = 6` instead of `4`.

## Impact
In `_previewWithdraw()`, users might get the wrong `fill` amount according to the withdrawal order.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think [this removal logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L339) was added so that users can withdraw only once.

We can use the mapping to save the withdrawal state for each user instead of removing orders from the tree.
