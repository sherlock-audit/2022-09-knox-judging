# call() should be used instead of transfer()



## Summary
```transfer()``` function may fail. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Deprecated ```transfer()``` function to a non-EOA address will fail when:
1-The receiver contract doesn't have a payable function
2-The receiver contract has a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas
3-The receiver contract is called through a proxy which uses up to 2300 gas

## Impact
Customers using non-EOA accounts cannot withdraw their ERC20 tokens if the account has anything more than a basic receive() payable callback 

## Code Snippet
~~~
155:     function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external {
156:         require(_amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
157:         require(_amount <= balanceOf(msg.sender), "Amount exceeds balance");
158: 
159:         _ensureLinkAmount(_amount);
160: 
161:         _burnShares(msg.sender, convertToShares(_amount));
162: 
163:         IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, _amount);      //@audit-issue transfer
164: 
165:         emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _amount);
166:     }

176:     function withdrawAll() external {
177:         uint256 amount = balanceOf(msg.sender);
178:         require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
179: 
180:         _ensureLinkAmount(amount);
181: 
182:         _burnShares(msg.sender, shares[msg.sender]);
183: 
184:         IERC20(LINK).transfer(msg.sender, amount);      //@audit-issue transfer
185: 
186:         emit Withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
187:     }
