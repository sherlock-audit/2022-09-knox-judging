# [NAZ-M5] Usage of Deprecated `Transfer()` Can Result In Revert

## Summary
`_redeem()` uses deprecated `transfer()` function which can result in a revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`transfer()` uses a fixed amount of gas, which was used to prevent reentrancy. However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

## Impact
Specifically, the `_redeem()` will inevitably fail when: 
1. The redeemer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function. 
2. The redeemer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. 
3. The redeemer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.


## Code Snippet
[`QueueInternal.sol#L129`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/queue/QueueInternal.sol#L129)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use call instead of `transfer()`. Example: `(bool succeeded, ) = _to.call{value: _amount}(""); require(succeeded, "Transfer failed.");`
