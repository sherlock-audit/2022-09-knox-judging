# Never use .transfer(). Use call instead.

## Summary

The function _redeem uses .transfer instead of call to transfer unredeemed share amount to the receiver. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The withdrawal will inevitably fail when: 

1. The withdrawer smart contract does not implement a payable fallback function.
2. The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which uses more than 2300 gas units. 
3. The withdrawer smart contract implements a payable fallback function which needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through a proxy that raises the callâ€™s gas usage above 2300.

## Impact

Transfer will fail if ever the recipient uses more than that gas. Use call() instead of transfer() when transferring eth. However, keep in mind to follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern to reduce the risk of reentrancy when using call() function.

## Code Snippet

```
128        // transfers unredeemed share amount to the receiver
129        require(Vault.transfer(receiver, unredeemedShares), "transfer failed");
```
