# _getNextFriday() returns wrong value when timestamp is between Monday 12am and 8am.

## Summary
`_getNextFriday(Monday)` should return next Friday 8am timestamp. But if timestamp is on a Monday 12am - 8am, it will wrongly return the same week Friday.

## Vulnerability Detail

`friday8am - timestamp < 4 days` check fails when the `timestamp` is between Monday 12am to Monday 8am, since `friday8am - timestamp > 4 days`. It will wrongly return the same week Friday instead of next Friday.

## Impact

`_setOptionParameters()` relies on `_getNextFriday()` to set option's expiry. When the timestamp is between Monday 12am and Monday 8am, expiry date will be wrong causing malfunction of protocol.

## Code Snippet

[VaultInternal.sol#L746-L759](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/vault/VaultInternal.sol#L746-L759)
```solidity
    function _getNextFriday(uint256 timestamp) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // dayOfWeek = 0 (sunday) - 6 (saturday)
        uint256 dayOfWeek = ((timestamp / 1 days) + 4) % 7;
        uint256 nextFriday = timestamp + ((7 + 5 - dayOfWeek) % 7) * 1 days;
        uint256 friday8am = nextFriday - (nextFriday % (24 hours)) + (8 hours);

        // If the timestamp is on a Friday or between Monday-Thursday
        // return Friday of the following week
        if (timestamp >= friday8am || friday8am - timestamp < 4 days) {
            friday8am += 7 days;
        }
        return friday8am;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add 8 hours to the check when doing subtraction of `friday8am - timestamp`.

```diff
    function _getNextFriday(uint256 timestamp) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        // dayOfWeek = 0 (sunday) - 6 (saturday)
        uint256 dayOfWeek = ((timestamp / 1 days) + 4) % 7;
        uint256 nextFriday = timestamp + ((7 + 5 - dayOfWeek) % 7) * 1 days;
        uint256 friday8am = nextFriday - (nextFriday % (24 hours)) + (8 hours);

        // If the timestamp is on a Friday or between Monday-Thursday
        // return Friday of the following week
-       if (timestamp >= friday8am || friday8am - timestamp < 4 days) {
+       if (timestamp >= friday8am || friday8am - timestamp < (4 days + 8 hours)) {
            friday8am += 7 days;
        }
        return friday8am;
    }
}
```
