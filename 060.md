# Fee on transfer token not considered

## Summary
In _swapForPoolTokens function, it is not checked whether tokenIn is taking some fees while transfer. This causes Exchange contract receiving lesser tokens than expected

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the _swapForPoolTokens function

```python
function _swapForPoolTokens(
        IExchangeHelper Exchange,
        IExchangeHelper.SwapArgs calldata s,
        address tokenOut
    ) internal returns (uint256) {

...
if (s.amountInMax > 0) {
            IERC20(s.tokenIn).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(Exchange),
                s.amountInMax
            );
        }

        uint256 amountCredited =
            Exchange.swapWithToken(
                s.tokenIn,
                tokenOut,
                s.amountInMax + msg.value,
                s.callee,
                s.allowanceTarget,
                s.data,
                s.refundAddress
            );

...
}
```

2. As we can see contract is trying to transfer funds to Exchange say amount 100 but due to fees Exchange receive only amount 90
3. Now swapWithToken is called with s.amountInMax  even though contract never received this fund (since some deducted in fees)

## Impact
Contract internal funds may get used up for user swap

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take the balance before and post the transfer and then deduct them to avail the obtained amount
