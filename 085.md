# Unbounded length loop could cause DoS in `withdraw()`

## Summary

In `_previewWithdraw()`, there is no limit on the length of array `orderbook`. When the `orderbook` grow too big, and the blockchain network is congested, it is possible that `withdraw()` function will fail due to DoS. And user funds could get locked temporarily or forever.


## Vulnerability Detail


As this array `orderbook` can grow quite large, the transactionâ€™s gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function at all. 


## Impact

`withdraw()` function could fail due to DoS. And user funds could get locked temporarily or forever.

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits, or split the loop and continue if it is too long.
