# Lack of price freshness check in PricerInternal.sol#_latestAnswer64x64() allows a stale price to be used

## Summary
You must make sure that the value from the latestRoundData() function is recent enough to be used.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation, there is no freshness check. This could lead to stale prices being used.

If the market price of the token drops very quickly ("flash crashes"), and Chainlink's feed does not get updated in time, the smart contract will continue to believe the token is worth more than the market value.

Chainlink also advise developers to check for the updatedAt before using the price.
## Impact

You may have a wrong price of token from the chainlink oracle, which returns the wrong price in getDeltaStrikePrice64x64() function.

## Code Snippet
````
function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
        (, int256 basePrice, , , ) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 underlyingPrice, , , ) =
            UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make sure to check that the price given by the chainlink is updated enough to be used.
