# getDeltaStrikePrice64x64() need sanity check

## Summary

Premia has a certain strike price range requirement, if the strike price derived from getDeltaStrikePrice64x64() is out of the range, the option can not be written. The auction has to be canceled. 


## Vulnerability Detail

If the strike price derived might be out of Premia's price range, the option will not be written, but revert at the end of the auction.

## Impact

Auction might be canceled at last. 
User fund will sit idle stop working and users lose the yield.
