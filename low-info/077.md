# Unsafe usage of ERC20 transfer and transferFrom

## Summary
The USDT's transfer and transferFrom functions doesn't return a bool, so the call to these functions will revert although the user has enough balance and the QueueInternal contract won't work, assuming that token is USDT.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Some ERC20 tokens functions don't return a boolean, for example USDT, BNB, OMG. So the QueueInternal contract simply won't work with tokens like that as the token.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/queue/QueueInternal.sol#L129

     'require(Vault.transfer(receiver, unredeemedShares), "transfer failed");'

## Tool used
Manual auditing - VS Code and me :)

## Recommendation
Use the OpenZepplin's safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions
