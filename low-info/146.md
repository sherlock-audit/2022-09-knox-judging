# `ERC20.approve()` is missing the return value check.

## Summary
`ERC20.approve()` is missing the return value check.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ERC20.approve()` is missing the return value check.

Some `ERC20` tokens don't revert if the approval is failed but return `false` instead.

In this protocol, there is no special requirements of `ERC20` token and it migth work unexpectedly with such weird tokens.

## Impact
With the tokens that don't actually perform the approve and return `false` are still counted as a correct approve.
