# AuctionInternal: Loop in _processOrders may cause system to get stuck

## Summary
AuctionInternal: Loop in _processOrders may cause system to get stuck
## Vulnerability Detail
In the_processOrders function of the AuctionInternal contract, all the elements in the orderbook are iterated, and if there are too many elements in the orderbook, the _processOrders function may revert due to exceeding the block size gas limit.
## Impact
This may cause system to get stuck
