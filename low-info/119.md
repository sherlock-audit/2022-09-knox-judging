# <ARRAY>.LENGTH SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF A FOR-LOOP and Increments can be unchecked for Gas Optimizations

## Summary
<ARRAY>.LENGTH SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UP IN EVERY LOOP OF A FOR-LOOP and Increments can be unchecked for Gas Optimizations 

## Vulnerability Detail
code line : knox-contracts/contracts/auction/Auction.sol#L440
knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L298
knox-contracts/contracts/auction/AuctionInternal.sol#L381

###  The overheads outlined below are PER LOOP, excluding the first loop
storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (100 gas)
memory arrays use MLOAD (3 gas)
calldata arrays use CALLDATALOAD (3 gas)
++I COSTS LESS GAS THAN I++
Caching the length changes each of these to a DUP<N> (3 gas), and gets rid of the extra DUP<N> needed to store the stack offset
uint256 length = arr.length;
For example
for (uint i; i < length; ) {
// do stuff
unchecked { ++i; }
}
