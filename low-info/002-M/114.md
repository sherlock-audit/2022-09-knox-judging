# Manipulations of withdrawalFee64x64/performanceFee64x64

## Summary
Manipulations of withdrawalFee64x64/performanceFee64x64

## Vulnerability Detail

The owner can set the performanceFee64x64/withdrawalFee64x64 to a number close to ONE_64x64 in the setPerformanceFee64x64/setWithdrawalFee64x64 functions of the VaultAdmin contract, which may cause the             feeInCollateral in the _collectPerformanceFee function and feeInCollateral/feesInShortContracts in _collectWithdrawalFee function to be too large.

## Impact
This causes the user to receive too few tokens.
