# initializeEpoch() need to prevent repeated call in the same epoch

## Summary
Although initializeEpoch() has onlyKeeper restriction, but it is no guarantee that the call will not be repeated, causing Invalid epoch
## Vulnerability Detail
A new epoch is added every time it is called, but if the old epoch is not completed, the epoch is lost
```solidity
    function initializeEpoch() external onlyKeeper {
...
        l.epoch = l.epoch + 1;
....
}
```
## Impact
the old epoch is not completed, the old epoch is will lost

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```solidity
    function initializeEpoch() external onlyKeeper {
+        require(l.startTime==0 || (l.auctionProcessed==false && lastInitEpochTime - block.timestamp > 1 days) )
+        lastInitEpochTime = block.timestamp

....
....
}
```
