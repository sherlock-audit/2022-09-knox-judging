# Insufficient validation in Oracle price data feed

## Summary

When fetching prices from `latestRoundData`, there is not enough check to ensure the price returned is not stale.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `PricerInternal.sol#_latestAnswer64x64` function fetches oracle price from Chainlink using `latestRoundData`, but it doesn't check if the returned `basePrice` is stale or not.

## Impact

This may lead to stale price to be used.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-09-knox/blob/main/knox-contracts/contracts/pricer/PricerInternal.sol#L49-L55
```solidity
    function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
        (, int256 basePrice, , , ) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();
        (, int256 underlyingPrice, , , ) =
            UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

change the implementation of `PricerInternal.sol#_latestAnswer64x64` to:

```solidity
      function _latestAnswer64x64() internal view returns (int128) {
        (uint80 roundID, int basePrice,,uint256 updatedAt,uint80 answeredInRound) = BaseSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        require(basePrice != 0, "base price is 0");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "base price stale");
        
        (uint80 roundID, int256 underlyingPrice, ,uint256 updatedAt,uint80 answeredInRound) = UnderlyingSpotOracle.latestRoundData();

        require(underlyingPrice != 0, "underlying price is 0");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "underlying price stale");

        return ABDKMath64x64.divi(underlyingPrice, basePrice);
    }
```
