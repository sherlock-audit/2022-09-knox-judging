# M-04 Unchecked Approve / Should use safeApprove

## Summary

[Some tokens do not revert on failure](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#missing-return-values)

Two instances of the code do not use safeApprove, meaning that if the token doesn't revert on failure, funds may be stuck or lost due to reverts.

## Impact

If the approve fails silently, the contracts will stop working
