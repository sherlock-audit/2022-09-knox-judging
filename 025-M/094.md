# Early user can manipulate _convertToAssets of vault, stealing funds from later depositers

## Summary
Early depositer can deposit and redeem 1 wei of asset. They can then manipulate the asset per share ratio and withdraw false number of assets from later depositers. This is a well-known attack vector of vault based contracts using precision loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious early user deposits 1 wei of assets into the queue, and then calls redeem function depositing that 1 wei into the vault and receive 1 wei of share token. Attacker can then send 1e18 -1 of asset token directly to the vault, making the price ratio of the vault equal 1e18 assets per share token. When future deposited deposits  19e17 tokens, that deposited only gets 1 wei of share token due to precision loss, instantly losing access to 9e17 asset tokens.

## Impact
Attacker profits from manipulating price and stealing funds from late depositors.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _deposit(
        address caller,
        address receiver,
        uint256 assetAmount,
        uint256 shareAmount,
        uint256 assetAmountOffset,
        uint256 shareAmountOffset
    ) internal virtual {
        uint256 assetAmountNet = assetAmount - assetAmountOffset;

        if (assetAmountNet > 0) {
            IERC20(_asset()).safeTransferFrom(
                caller,
                address(this),
                assetAmountNet
            );
        }

        uint256 shareAmountNet = shareAmount - shareAmountOffset;

        if (shareAmountNet > 0) {
            _mint(receiver, shareAmountNet);
        }

        _afterDeposit(receiver, assetAmount, shareAmount);

        emit Deposit(caller, receiver, assetAmount, shareAmount);
    }
```

```solidity
function _previewWithdraw(uint256 assetAmount)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        returns (uint256 shareAmount)
    {
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply();

        if (supply == 0) {
            shareAmount = assetAmount;
        } else {
            uint256 totalAssets = _totalAssets();

            if (totalAssets == 0) {
                shareAmount = assetAmount;
            } else {
                shareAmount =
                    (assetAmount * supply + totalAssets - 1) /
                    totalAssets;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation

Require a minimum deposit amount when starting, or send initial mint to a reserve DAO.
