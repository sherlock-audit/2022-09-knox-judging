# [NAZ-M3] First ERC4626 vault deposit exploit can break share calculation

## Summary
`convertToShares` function follows the formula: `assetAmount * supply / totalAssets`. The share price always return 1:1 with asset token. If everything work normally, share price will slowly increase with time to 1:2 or 1:10 as more rewards coming in. But right after ERC4626 vault contract creation, during first cycle, any user can deposit 1 share set `totalSupply = 1`. And transfer token to vault to inflate `totalAssets()` before rewards kick in. (Basically, pretend rewards themselves before anyone can deposit in to get much better share price.) This can inflate base share price as high as 1:1e18 early on, which force all subsequence deposit to use this share price as base.

## Vulnerability Detail
New ERC4626 vault share price can be manipulated right after creation. Which give early depositor greater share portion of the vault during the first cycle. While deposit token also affected by rounding precision (due to exploit above) that always return lesser amount of share for user.

## Impact
New ERC4626 vault share price can be manipulated right after creation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making sure someone always deposited first so `totalSupply` becomes high enough that this exploit becomes irrelevant.
